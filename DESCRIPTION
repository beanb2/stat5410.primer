Description: The package is designed to provide solutions to introductory 
    homework problems designed to measure a students proficiency in R before 
    starting the course. The intent is not to discourage students from taking 
    the course but to give them a more realistic view as to how much time
    this course will take them given their prior programming knowledge.
